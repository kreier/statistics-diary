2025,01.08.2025,15,** Friday: Thứ Sáu - Ngươi phải thờ phượng Giê-hô-va Đức Chúa Trời của ngươi
2025,15.08.2025,20,** Friday - It is Jehovah your God you must worship. But what is pure worship? 6 points to identify:
2025,20.10.2025,46,"** Monday morning I visit the embassy at 8:00 AM, right when they open. My visa should be prepared, I submitted the documents last Thursday already. But I will have to wait 2 more hours until I finally get my visa and can return to Vietnam!"
2025,24.10.2025,50,"** It is Friday morning, no time for breakfast. The motorbike is repaired, the holes in the tires are fixed, I am ready for the long planed second motorbike journey from Saigon to Hanoi: [[2025-10-24 Hanoi and Hà Giang]]. For this Friday it is Saigon - Măng Đen 624.1 km"
2025,27.10.2025,96,"** Monday: It is the first day of my study at the University of Education Ho Chi Minh City (*Trường Đại học Sư phạm TP. Hồ Chí Minh*) as a bachelor of Vietnamese Language and Culture of Vietnam (*Ngành Tiếng Việt và Văn Hóa Việt Nam*). We have our meeting over Google Meet for 2 hours (since I am in **Hanoi**) and the first 5 students meet there, most for the first time. Two other students are **still in China** and are waiting for their visa. I added a page to my Obsidian vault under [https://saiht.de/obsidian/Daily-notes/2025-10-27-Extend-projects](https://saiht.de/obsidian/Daily-notes/2025-10-27-Extend-projects)."
2025,28.10.2025,217,"** Tuesday: It is too early for the Yamaha dealers in the city to open, and at 7:00 AM the streets are already packed and full of traffic jams. Let’s just leave the city and do the oil change later. Finally did it at [Yamaha Ba Vi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a3seJN7kZCywALND6), the Yamaha town a town earlier was moved and Google Maps not updated yet. As it turns out, the front fender is broken (one screw hole has the plastic broken out). And the brake pad is down to the metal and needs to be replaced. Didn’t I just replace it? Check my diary, it was 14.6.2023 - more than 2 years ago! Odo back then was just 13025 kilometers, we are now at 42477 km. And I need to change the ball bearings for the front wheel. Didn't I change this recently as well? Yes, December 2024 after the road trip around the Tonle Sap in Cambodia and a visit to Siem Reap and Battambang. Odo then 28035 km. Well, then let’s fix that! Including oil change for the motor and rear tire gearbox and labour just 500,000 VND or 16.30 Euro. It turned out to be a great preparation for Sapa (1400m) and the trail to Fansipan (1900m starting height) and the whole Ha Giang loop a week later."
2025,29.10.2025,41,"** Wednesday: I start the day relaxed with a breakfast 7:00 AM, then refill at the gas station. Check out the Núi Xẻ Ranger Station Trạm Tôn for a future tour at 9:00 AM, and yes - **you need a guide**!"
2025,30.10.2025,42,"** Thursday: Will I be able to visit the Trung Tam congregation in the evening? It was my plan, but as soon as I entered the house of Nhung's younger sister there was nowhere to go. I had a great time, though!"
2025,31.10.2025,55,"** Friday: Hanoi is a strange place. The streets are way to narrow for cars, but somehow you get a car and a motorbike passing on these narrow roads. And patiently everyone is moving at snails speed. While it simply won't stop raining. With the car we arrive dry and safe at the kingdom hall."
2025,01.11.2025,56,"** Saturday: We have to drive to Long Bien to the home of Thai. In front of the house of his parents a large tent for 300 people is prepared. The invitation reads 11:00 am, but Tram wrote us already that times in the north are different, it starts at 10:00. And we can arrive earlier."
2025,02.11.2025,77,"** Sunday: Initially I wanted to pick up Minh at the airport after she said farewell to her parents. But I meet with Markus for the first time for real in Hanoi, and before you know it's much later. It is still slightly raining, and I can't leave the family of Nhung's relatives without having a meal, and get things packed. Even after 3 days my long pants are not dry yet. But I have no option."
2025,10.11.2025,77,"** Monday: The first time studying at Sư Phạm in person! The 15 minute drive takes 40 minutes, so a little later. Our lessons are 8:30 to 11:30, and our second teacher has an even longer journey from Nha Be. Our Korean student is missing this week. Hopefully next week we’re finally all together as a class in person! 4 students from China, and Phô Mai from Laos. With me we are 7 students from 4 nations."
2025,14.11.2025,147,"** Friday: Finally another 5k run. Ready by 5:20, but only out at 5:35 with some fog. At least it is dry after the rain yesterday. Still with a pace over 6 minutes, but it’s been a while. Breakfast 35k with **Set Tỉnh Táo** (*Bánh mì ốp la* and *Pha Phin Cà Phê Sữa L* - previously Combo A lớn). I open my old **Sabbatical diary** - *a whole year is missing!* It needs to be synced with a future Obsidian vault, and some parts of multiple imports to a wordpress blog. The German parts from 2008 to 2010 probably need some translation. Until 11:00 AM we are already at November 2025 and update today! Got new fresh Arabica beans coffee from Sơn Nam, packed just today and originating from [Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JN5spmVKk8Hi2Jtv7) ([The Coffee Farm Cầu Đất](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bRSVpWuRxvoGJkEZ7)) near Dalat (38 minutes, 24 km) for now 380,000 VND/kg."
2025,18.11.2025,52,"** Tuesday. Teacher day is two days earlier for our department and starts at 8:00 am and there is no afternoon lesson. Go climbing at Crescent mall in the afternoon? It's a great time with our group, all 7 students are together. And the students prepare a good show for the teachers."
2025,06.12.2025,62,"** Saturday: The south-eastern congregations like Nha Trang have their assembly in [Xuân Trường](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vVLzTCCPmQeXC4CC7) at the connected kingdom halls. According to Google Maps 2h39 for 101km with a two-wheeler (my NVX). Start early at 6:00 with breakfast, drive from 6:30 to 9:09 and get ready before the program starts with music at 9:40 for “[Hear What the Spirit Says to the Congregations](https://www.jw.org/en/library/programs/2025-2026-Circuit-Assembly-Program-With-Branch-Representative/Hear-What-the-Spirit-Says-to-the-Congregations/)”."
2025,07.12.2025,92,"** Sunday: A week ago I was invited by Xuong and Linh to visit them at their congregation , since Xuong is giving a talk. That's my journey on this Sunday, and we spend time together until the afternoon. The [new kingdom hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q7hf8jaVtphUPDxN8) is already 3 years old. But only a month ago the 4 air conditioners were installed - and it's a big difference! Prior to that it was rather hot, you hear the dogs barking from outside, or neighbours with their Karaoke. Now you can easily focus on your study."
2025,12.12.2025,91,"** Friday: The Black Virgin Mountain (*núi Bà Đen*) is only 2.5 hours away from the Su Pham university. My lesson finishes at 11:30, so I could be there at 14:00. I finally decide eat lunch first, so leave at 12:10 and arrive at 14:30. Which is a little too late, the guard for the easy hiking trail won't let anyone hike up the mountain after 14:00. Without break it takes 2 hours, I would arrive at the top at 16:00 or later, and still have to buy a ticket down."
